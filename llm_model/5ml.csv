question,Answer
Explain the evolution of machine learning from its early days to modern times. How did the field's goals and approaches change over time?,"['Early days focused on mimicking human cognitive processes', 'Shift from symbolic methods to statistical and probabilistic approaches', 'Focus shifted from achieving artificial intelligence to solving practical problems', 'Rise of deep learning and its impact on various fields']"
"Explain the concept of 'generalization' in machine learning. How is it related to the bias-variance trade-off, and what are the implications for model performance?","['Generalization is the ability of a model to perform well on unseen data', 'Bias-variance trade-off: a balance between underfitting and overfitting', ""Underfitting: model is too simple and cannot capture the data's complexity"", 'Overfitting: model is too complex and memorizes the training data, leading to poor generalization', 'Optimal model complexity: finding the sweet spot between bias and variance for good generalization']"
